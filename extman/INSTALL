Prerequisites
=============

see README

INSTALL steps
===============

This is the first version of INSTALL, it's simple and crude, only conver
how to setup a CGI version extman. Please follow the steps describe here,
hope it would make sense. Currently ExtMan does not support FCGI or other
high performance technology, not like the ExtMail :-)

Step1 - Download
================

Get the latest source from the official ExtMail website:
http://www.extmail.org/download/

unpack the source tar.gz and copy to /var/www/extsuite/, rename the
extman-0.xxx to extman

Step2 - Configure
=================
Before you begin to config apache and extman, make sure that apache build
with at least mod_cgi support. Refer to apache manual for cgi information
in detail.

Here we only conver the standard cgi configuration;

please put the following cgi script to /path/to/cgi-bin/ of your apache
installation, chmod +x to it and point browser to the script, if it works
then cgi module is ok.

#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "Hello world!\n";

You should see Hello world! if mod_cgi enabled and configured properly.

*) Apache + Suexec
Currently we recommend and that you try apache + suexec installation, 
for maximum flexibility and facility reason.

Make sure your apache build in Suexec, generally common Linux or BSD-like
OS will come with some pre-complie apache packages, eg RPM or PKG.

Most of them have suexec builtin. If you build apache manualy, please en-
sure that suexec activated and works correctly, refer to suexec manual for
more information and configration.

1)Add a new virtual host to apache, example configuration is:

NameVirtualHost *:80
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName mail.example.com
DocumentRoot /path/to/your/document/root/
ScriptAlias /extman/cgi /var/www/extsuite/extman/cgi
Alias /extman /var/www/extsuite/extman/html
SuexecUserGroup vuser vgroup
</VirtualHost>

The SuexecUserGroup derective contain user/group that suexec will su to.
Make sure that your email system MDA will deliver email as that uid/gid,
or will cause permission problem.

2)Then chown the uid/gid of /var/www/extsuite/extman/cgi/ to vuser/vgrop,
including the direcotry. Su to root:

# chown -R vuser.vgroup /var/www/extsuite/extman/cgi/

*)Apache + uid/gid change

This is another way to run extman with less security problem. Configuration
is easy, change User and Group directives in httpd.conf to the uid/gid of
maildir, for example your maildir own by vuser/vgroup, then change User and
Group to:

# vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

User vuser
Group vgroup

Save httpd.conf

Config extman
==============
1)Restart apache, and try to access http://mail.example.com/extman/, your
browser will be redirected to /extman/cgi/index.cgi if everything works fine.

2)Configure /var/www/extsuite/extman/webman.cf

Edit webmail.cf file:

Change SYS_CONFIG and relate setting to match the above path, then change
SYS_BACKEND_TYPE to ldap or mysql, this is up to your choice. Fill out
SYS_MYSQL_* parameters if you choose mysql, or SYS_LDAP_* if you choose
ldap.

Select which encryption mechanism you want to use as user password, avaliable
mechanism since 0.2.x are:

crypt|cleartext|plain|md5|plain-md5|ldap-md5|sha|sha1

Customize other parameters to fit your envirnment, refer to the webman.cf
for parameters explanation in detail.

3)Try to login with your existing account and password.

Step3 - Debug
=============

* openLDAP

Su to root and shutdown slapd, then run:
/usr/sbin/slapd -d 256

This command will invoke slapd in debug mode, then try to do some task in
extman to see how the searh/modify procedure is happening.

* MySQL

Edit /etc/my.cnf and add the following:

[mysqld]
log=/var/lib/mysql/sql.log

Then all SQL statement will be written to /var/lib/mysql/sql.log, check
this log and see whether the SQL is correct or not.
