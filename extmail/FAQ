Q: Why does extmail use /var/www/extsuite/extmail as base directory?
A: Because in most suexec installation, the AP_DOC_ROOT set to /var/www,
   so if extmail place outside the AP_DOC_ROOT, then suexec will refuse
   to execute and return error. This is a suexec security reason.

Q: Why does extmail not support mbox/mbx or IMAP/POP3?
A: mbox/mbx sucks in most of email operation, eg: add/remove/update. And
   the second reason is, that mbox/mbx or maildir are the backend of most
   opensource imap/pop3 server, so why not access maildir directly?

Q: Will direct maildir access cause security problem?
A: In general the answer is *NO*! But please pay more attention to the
   security of suexec and apache configuration.

Q: How could i get FastCGI to my webserver?
A: Since 0.23-20060104 extmail ship with FastCGI support, please make
   sure that your web server was supported by extmail, currently the
   experimental FastCGI support tested under Apache and lighttpd. And
   please refer to the webserver manual for FastCGI support and the
   configuration information, then refer to README.fcgi to get help.

Q: Why i encounter bad characters under FreeBSD?
A: Under some version, the Text::Iconv module broken, and please remove
   it and extmail will automatically use Encode instead, it's fine
