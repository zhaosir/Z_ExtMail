  o Fast operation on large file (100M+) via optimize I/O library

  o Multi-language and template support, easy customization

  o Fully UTF-8 and multi-charset conversion support, eg CJK.

Prerequisites:
==============

  perl 5.006 or above, 5.008 is recommended
  Encode (2.0 or higher) or Text::Iconv
  Module DB_File (already include in perl)
  Module Symbol (already include in perl)
  Module Fcntl (already include in perl)

  A working web server with CGI support, apache is recommended

  using tools/pkg_stats.sh to check which module required is not present:
  # cd /path/to/extmail-source
  # . ./tools/pkg_stats.sh

Optional modules:
=================

  Net::LDAP - need this if ldap authentication activated
  DBI - need this if mysql authentication activated
  Benchmark - need this if developer want debug information

Recommand software
==================

For reducing effort, we highly recommand that use pre-complied software,
such as RPM or BSD pkgs, including perl, apache, and mysql or ldap etc..

Linux - RPM/deb is prefer
FreeBSD - pkg is prefer
 
Directory
=========

  html  - the template directory, every theme should have a sub directory
  cgi   - the cgi scripts directory
  libs  - the extmail lib and related packages
  lang  - I18n locale directory, translator may want to look at it :)
  tools - include session cleanup and some useful small tools

INSTALL
=======

See INSTALL in the latest distribution

FastCGI Support
===============

Since 0.23-20060104 extmail ship with FastCGI support, please refer to the
README.fcgi to get help in detail

Drawbacks:
==========

  o not support mbox/mbx or imap/pop3, but why mb*/pop3/imap?

  o Too simple, but complex make things mass and slow, why complex?
